The Intel Project is a simple and interactive educational website designed to introduce core concepts of computer science to beginners.
It includes separate sections on important topics such as Cybersecurity, C Programming, Database Management Systems (DBMS), Data Structures and 
Algorithms (DSA), and Networking. Each section is represented by an individual HTML page that features educational content, relevant images,
and JavaScript files that add interactivity.The website uses basic web development technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling,
and JavaScript for functionality. All pages are linked to a central homepage named INTEL.HTML, and the design is intended to be clean, 
easy to navigate, and informative for students or anyone new to the field of computer science.To run the project, users simply need to open 
the file named INTEL.HTML in any modern web browser. From there, they can access the different topic pages through the provided links. The folder
also contains image files to visually support the learning material and make the website more engaging.
This project is ideal for those who are just starting out with web development or looking to build a simple portfolio project.
